        Connor is affiliated with the VTubers of VShojo, particularly Ironmouse, as they often collaborate and he even cosplayed her. In February 2022, he started appearing as Vtuber Bubi, a supporting character in the Ironmouse lore. He also once appeared in one of Kureiji Ollie's streams, who was so elated about one of her favorite YouTubers watching her that she promoted him to chat moderator. Another VTuber he has collaborated with is RainhoeVT, who has been a long-time moderator for him.
