        Connor created his channel on February 11, 2014, and uploaded his first video in April of that year. His videos quickly garnered attention after he started doing voice impressions.His most notable ones revolved around Sebastian Michaelis, a character from the anime Black Butler, since his voice sounds vaguely similar to that of the character's voice actor J. Michael Tatum. Nowadays, his videos have branched from purely anime/voice acting related to a wider variety.
